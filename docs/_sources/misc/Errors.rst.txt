Errors
========

You can't avoid errors at any cost. You code, you make mistakes.

..  rubric::
    Crucial parts of the code have been wrapped in three places in try except block:

#.  operator invoke.
#.  drawing callback
#.  modal loop


..  rubric:: They generate following error message respectively:

#.  Invoke Failed, check console for details
#.  Drawing Failed, check console for details
#.  Modal Failed, check console for details


..  rubric::  Notes:

*   I don't know much about error handling.
*   I had logged the error in file, but removed that part, considering it unnecessary.
