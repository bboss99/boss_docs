Future updates
==================

A lot needs to be done but this is roughly next version should have.


..  rubric:: These are new user features, you can expect.

#.  Keyboard inputs. It is not ready to take event, at the moment it's hard coded to make textfield work,
    it will be made more generic,like ``addKeyboardEvent('A','Down',callable)``

#.  Saving, loading UI data in file and memory. At the moment, everything gets destroyed and again recreated.
    It's not causing any issue though.

#.  Making UI resizable

#.  Supporting UV and images, handling image better.

#.  Making two levels of Settings, one global settings and another operator level Settings to override global settings
    and maybe script level Settings as well.

..  rubric:: These are improvements:

#.  Almost every class needs improvement, that will improve performance of every script.

#.  Making existing code more readable and pythonic, organizing and renaming variables and classes.

#.  Making various kind of sliders, ColorField, DropDownBoxes available in ui_creator.py

#.  Making Deletion, enabling, disabling, parenting of ui easier.
